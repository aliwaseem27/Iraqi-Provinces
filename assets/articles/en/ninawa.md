# Nineveh Governorate

Nineveh Governorate (Kurdish: پارێزگای نەینەوا, Syriac: ܕܫܬܐ ܕܢܝܢܘ) is a province in northern Iraq, with its center in the city of Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq. It covers an area of 37,323 square kilometers (14,410 square miles), and its population is estimated at 3,729,998 according to the 2018 census, with about half of them residing in the city of Mosul, while the others are distributed among other cities and districts. Prior to 1976, it was called Mosul Province and included the current Dohuk Governorate. The second largest city in the province is Tal Afar, and the majority of its population are Turkmen.

Mosul City is considered part of Nineveh Governorate administratively, where the city of Nineveh originated in the Assyrian period on the left bank of the Tigris River, while Mosul City was established later than Nineveh on the right bank of the Tigris. Unlike the city of Nineveh whose landmarks disappeared, Mosul City has continued to expand since its inception. In the first half of the 20th century, Mosul City expanded to include the left bank of the Tigris River and encompassed the entire archaeological site of ancient Nineveh within its administrative boundaries. Currently, Mosul City is the center of Nineveh Governorate.

## History

### Early Settlement

Nineveh has an ancient history dating back to prehistoric times, where the earliest forms of civilization emerged, represented by the first agricultural villages in the Neolithic period, such as the village of Husuniyah in Shura, the village of Um al-Dibajiyah near Hadhar, and the village of al-Arbajiyyah. Civilization began to take shape with activities such as agriculture, animal husbandry, and construction.

### Assyrian Empire

Nineveh was settled around 6000 BCE, and by 3000 BCE, it became an important religious center for the worship of the god Assur. Greek documents written in the Hellenistic period mention Ninus as the founder of Nineveh. It was mentioned during the reign of the Assyrian king Shamshi-Adad I as a center for the worship of the goddess Ishtar. Nineveh became part of the Middle Assyrian Empire, and its population was estimated at 33,000 inhabitants. However, by the end of the Neo-Assyrian Empire, the population had reached about 120,000 inhabitants, making it the greatest city of that period.

### Sasanian Rule

Nineveh fell under Sasanian rule for a long time, which impoverished it and deprived it of much of its Assyrian identity. After the fall of ancient Nineveh, the population center moved to the other side of the Tigris River, where it provided a more fortified location due to its elevation surrounded by the river, known as "Qabr Ayyub". Later, it became known as Mosul after the Islamic conquest.

### Islamic Arab Conquest

The Islamic conquest of Mosul occurred during the reign of Caliph Umar ibn al-Khattab under the leadership of the Arab Muslim commander Rabia ibn al-Afki. At that time, Mosul was under the control of the Sasanians. The Arabs called it "al-Mawsil" because it connected between the Levant and Khurasan, later conquered by the Muslim Arabs. It was also called "al-Hadbah" because it had a minaret for the Grand Mosque, which was a curved minaret. It was also called "Um al-Rabeein" because of the long duration of spring in it, as its autumn is the second spring and its air is sweet.

## Location and Area

Nineveh Governorate is located in the northwestern part of Iraq. It is bordered by Dohuk Governorate to the north, Salah al-Din Governorate to the south, Kirkuk Governorate and Erbil Governorate to the east, and the Syrian Arab Republic to the west. The governorate's boundaries lie between longitudes 41°25' and 44°15' east and latitudes 34°15' and 37°3' north. The Tigris River traverses the province for a length of 214 kilometers, in addition to Lake Mosul Dam, which is 47.5 kilometers long, as well as the Upper Zab and the Khazir River, which has a tributary called Koma, passing through it. The area of the governorate is 37,323 square kilometers, which constitutes 8.6% of the area of the Republic of Iraq.

## Climate

Nineveh Governorate enjoys excellent climatic conditions, being the only province in Iraq with distinct spring and autumn seasons, hence its nickname "Mother of Two Springs." The climate varies depending on its surface topography. Winter temperatures generally range between -5°C and +8°C, while summer temperatures range between 40°C and 50°C.

## Topography

The Tigris River traverses the governorate in a wavy pattern from north to south, dividing it into two almost equal parts: the left bank and the right bank. The topography of Nineveh Governorate is divided into three sections: the mountainous region, the hills, and the undulating plateau.

## Agriculture

Agriculture in Nineveh is characterized by diversified farming. Due to its vast arable land, the majority of it is allocated to cultivating crops such as wheat, barley, cotton, chickpeas, corn, sunflowers, vegetables, legumes, oilseeds, and fodder. With the opening of irrigation projects, cultivated areas have expanded, and Nineveh is one of the leading provinces in grain production in Iraq.

## Tourism

The archaeological sites in Nineveh Governorate are diverse, including Assyrian, Babylonian, and Islamic archaeological sites such as Ashur, Nineveh, Nimrud, Hatra, and Ancient Mosul. The religious tourism is significant due to the presence of shrines of prophets such as the Prophet Jonah, Prophet Jerjis (St. George), Prophet Daniel, and others, as well as monasteries and churches like the Monastery of St. Elijah, Monastery of St. Hormizd, and Monastery of Sheikh Matti. Additionally, the beautiful natural landscapes attract tourists. The Spring Festival is held in Nineveh every year on April 15th to celebrate the onset of spring.
