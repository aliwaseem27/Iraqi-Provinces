# Baghdad Governorate

Baghdad Province is the smallest province in Iraq in terms of area. Baghdad ranks first among the provinces of Iraq in terms of population, with a population of approximately 8.4 million in 2016. It was built by the Abbasid Caliph Abu Ja'far al-Mansur in 145 Hijri. The Baghdad region is characterized by the passage of the Tigris River, which divides it into two halves: Al-Karkh and Al-Rusafa. Baghdad continued as the capital of the Abbasid state until the construction of the city of Samarra, where the capital of the caliphate shifted. It then returned as the capital of the Abbasid state until its fall to the Mongols in 656 Hijri. Baghdad is characterized by numerous ancient archaeological sites dating back to the dawn of civilizations, such as the Ziggurat of Aqarquf (the Tower of Korygalzus) and the Palace of Khosrow (Khosrow's Palace) in the Madain region, as well as many Islamic monuments such as the Al-Mustansiriya School, which is considered the first university in history. It also contains the tombs of prominent Muslims such as Imam Musa al-Kadhim, Abu Hanifa al-Nu'man, Abdul Qadir al-Jilani, Salman al-Farsi, and others. Baghdad became the capital of the state of Iraq at the beginning of the 20th century after World War I and witnessed a succession of royal to republican rule in 1958.
