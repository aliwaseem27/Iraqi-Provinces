# Al-Qadisiyah Governorate

Al-Qadisiyah Province is one of the provinces of the Middle Euphrates region in Iraq. It is traversed by a branch of the Euphrates River known as Shatt Al-Hilla, and upon entering Al-Diwaniyah, it is known as Shatt Al-Diwaniyah. The province is bordered to the north by Babil Province, to the west by Najaf Province, to the east by Wasit Province and Thi Qar Province, and to the south by Muthanna Province.

## History

The name Al-Diwaniyah emerged and gained prominence in the seventh decade of the twelfth Hijri century. It has been mentioned by Western and Eastern writers and tourists. The first to describe it in his journey, which began in 1754 and ended in 1758, was Dr. Adam Iyves. He mentioned:

"He traveled from Basra to Baghdad via the Euphrates River, describing the cities along the way, including Samawa, Lalmum, and Al-Diwaniyah."
Al-Diwaniyah is also mentioned in the book "The Traveler" by Abraham Parsons, who undertook a journey along the Euphrates River from Al-Hilla to Basra, describing Lalmum and mentioning that it is located south of Al-Diwaniyah in 1774.
In the book "Al-Saud's Journeys," Al-Diwaniyah is mentioned after the author talks about the departure of Governor Suleiman Pasha to discipline the Khaza'ah tribe for showing disobedience. He said:

"When the governor camped with his army west of the Euphrates opposite Al-Diwaniyah, the Khaza'ah tribes feared him, and that was in 1195 AH - 1780 AD."
In the same book, Al-Diwaniyah is described as follows:

"During the time of the governorate of Dawood Pasha in 1229 AH - 1813 AD, he appeared to discipline the tribes and marched until he reached Al-Diwaniyah, the headquarters of the Khaza'ah Rafidi tribe."
It also states:

"During the time of Dawood Pasha's governorate in 1234 AH - 1818 AD, the minister Saleh Al-Kurdi ordered one of his servants inside his palace to go out to discipline the two factions (Al-Zaqrit and Al-Shumrit), and from there he headed to discipline the Chalaiha tribe in Al-Diwaniyah."
As for the author of the book "Qurat Al-Ain fi Tarikh Al-Jazirah wal-Iraq wal-Nahrain," he described it as follows:

"Al-Diwaniyah is a prosperous city on the eastern side of the Euphrates, between Al-Hilla and Samawa. Its markets are good, its people are Arab and Muslim, and most of them are Twelver Shia. It (meaning Al-Diwaniyah) is the headquarters of the Khaza'ah tribe, founded in the eleventh Hijri century."
He probably meant Al-Hasakah, as Al-Diwaniyah did not exist in the eleventh Hijri century but was named after this century.

1834 marks the starting point of administrative organization in Iraq, which was established by the Ottoman government through a series of continuous administrative changes and modifications. In 1858, it represented an administrative district known as Al-Diwaniyah District, which was one of the administrative formations subordinate to the Hilla Brigade, which in turn belonged to Baghdad Province.
In 1890, its administrative status was raised to a brigade level, known as Al-Diwaniyah Brigade. It underwent numerous administrative changes on its map, fluctuating between expansion by annexing some areas to it and contraction by detaching some areas from its administrative jurisdiction, which was associated with changes in its population as well. In a new attempt to restructure the administrative organization in Iraq, Law No. 159 of 1969 was issued, dividing Iraq into sixteen main administrative units, each called a province instead of a brigade after making some amendments to its borders. Thus, Al-Diwaniyah Brigade became known as Al-Diwaniyah Province.

## Water Resources

Al-Diwaniyah has surface water resources, including a group of rivers and branching streams, as well as groundwater resources. However, they are not economically viable for agriculture due to their salinity and economic cost, in addition to the relative abundance of the stream network in the province. We will address them as follows:

1. **Shatt Al-Diwaniyah:**
   It is the longest watercourse in the province, with a length of (123 km) and a discharge capacity of (60 m3/s), irrigating an area of (550,000 dunams). Shatt Al-Diwaniyah passes through Al-Sinniyah district, the center of Al-Diwaniyah district, Al-Sadir district, and the center of Al-Hamza district, continuing its flow until it fades away in Al-Rumeitha district. Branching from it during its course is the modern Shafa'iyah canal, which is (30 km) long with a discharge of (30 m3/s) and irrigates an area of (91,630 dunams) distributed between the Shafa'iyah and Al-Sadir districts. From the Shafa'iyah canal, the modern Nuriyah canal branches off with a length of (28 km) and a discharge of (1.5 m3/s).

2. **Shatt Al-Daghara:**
   It, along with Shatt Al-Diwaniyah, represents the main tributaries of Shatt Al-Hilla and the main sources of irrigation water in the province. It is (70 km) long with a discharge capacity of (43 m3/s). The average area irrigated by it is (360,000 dunams) within the areas of Al-Daghara, Sumer, Afak, and Al-Badir. Several main and secondary canals branch off from it, totaling (20 canals), the most important of which are the Thureima canal and the northern and southern Huriyah canals on its eastern side. The average area irrigated by them is (10,793 dunams).

3. **Shatt Al-Shamiyah:**

   - Its boundaries enter the province from the northwest.
     Its boundaries enter the province from the northwest, branching from Shatt Al-Hindi (along with Shatt Al-Kufah) south of the city of Kufa. It passes through the areas of Al-Muhnaouiyah, Al-Salhiyah, the center of Al-Shamiyah district, and the Ghummas district before ending in several canals that flow into Shatt Al-Shanafiyyah to join the Euphrates River within the territories of Al-Shanafiyyah. It then branches again into the Sabeel and Al-Athshan branches to the southeast of the Al-Shanafiyyah district, covering a distance of (80 km) with a discharge capacity of (140.3 m3/s) irrigating an area of (384,000 dunams). From Shatt Al-Shamiyah, (128) canals branch off, the most important of which is the Muhnaouiyah canal with a length of (21 km) and a discharge capacity of (12 m3/s), irrigating an area of (25,000 dunams).

4. **Shatt Al-Shanafiyyah:**
   The Euphrates River appears in the study area due to the convergence of Shatt Al-Shanafiyyah with Shatt Al-Kufah (Abu Sakhir) north of the Al-Shanafiyyah district. The river continues its flow within its boundaries for a distance of (18.5 km), branching afterward into the Sabeel and Al-Athshan branches, which head southeast towards the Muthanna Province. The length of the river within the province is (70 km) with a maximum discharge capacity of (1790 m3/s), irrigating an area of (200,000 dunams).

## Administrative Divisions

The province currently includes fifteen administrative units, including four districts and eleven administrative units at the level of sub-district.

- **Al-Diwaniyah District**
- **Al-Shamiyah District**

- **Al-Hamza District**
