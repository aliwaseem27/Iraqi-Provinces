# Sulaymaniyah Governorate

Sulaymaniyah Governorate (in Kurdish: پارێزگای سلێمانی) is located in northeastern Iraq and is the fourth most populous Iraqi governorate, with a population of two and a half million. It is bordered by Iran to the east, Diyala Governorate to the south, Kirkuk Governorate to the west, which is rich in oil, and Erbil Governorate to the north.

There is disagreement about the reason for the name "Sulaymaniyah." Some believe that during the excavation for building the city, a ring was found engraved with the name Sulayman. However, others believe that it was named after Sultan Sulayman, the Ottoman ruler, while some argue that Ibrahim Pasha Baban named the city after his father, Sulayman Pasha.
