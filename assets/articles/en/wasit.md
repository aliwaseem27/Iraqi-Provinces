# Wasit Governorate

Wasit Governorate is a province located in central Iraq. It was named after the city of Wasit, which was built by Al-Hajjaj ibn Yusuf al-Thaqafi in 78 AH and completed in 86 AH to serve as a new headquarters for his troops. The current capital of Wasit Governorate is Al-Kut, which is characterized by its semi-peninsular shape surrounded by water from the east, west, and south. It is located 180 kilometers south of Baghdad and is connected to southern Iraq. There is an academic study suggesting the inclusion of Bald Ruz city, currently in Diyala Governorate, into Wasit Governorate.

Al-Kut city, the capital of Wasit Governorate, is surrounded by the Tigris River, and the Al-Kut Dam was built by the province's residents under British supervision in the first half of the 20th century (1938). Wasit Governorate borders Diyala Governorate to the northeast, Maysan Governorate to the southeast, Dhi Qar Governorate to the southwest along the Ghareef River, Dhi Qar has the Qar Waterway for irrigation and the Al-Abyad Dam with a storage capacity of 25 million cubic meters. From the west, Wasit borders Qadisiyah Governorate with its center in Al-Diwaniyah city, and Babylon Governorate with its center in Al-Hillah city, which are the closest cities to Wasit from the west. To the east, it borders the city of Mehran in Iran.

Al-Kut is situated on the Tigris River, with branches including the Dijla, Al-Gharraf, Shatt Al-Shatrah, Shatt Al-Badaa, and others. It is a flat area with a transitional climate between the Mediterranean and hot, dry desert climates. Rainfall is scarce, and temperatures are high. Temperatures begin to rise in March, reaching their peak in July and August.

## Naming

Wasit was named after the historical city of Wasit, which was built by Al-Hajjaj ibn Yusuf al-Thaqafi. Historians differ on the construction date of Wasit city, but most sources indicate that it was built between 57-86 AH (694-705 CE). However, according to historical sources, Al-Hajjaj began building his city in 81 AH (700 CE). Some suggest that the reason for naming the city Wasit is because the site chosen by Al-Hajjaj for his city was called Wasit Al-Qasab, and because its land was reed land, it was named Wasit. It was also said that Wasit was named because its location is midway between Kufa and Basra.
