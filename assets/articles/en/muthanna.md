## Economic Situation

Muthanna Governorate was previously one of the agricultural areas, but the cessation or decrease in rainfall, which led to a significant reduction in the water level in the Euphrates River, greatly reduced agricultural production. Among the most important crops cultivated in the governorate are wheat, barley, and rice. It is also surrounded by palm groves in the districts of Samawah, Al-Khidhr, and Al-Rumaythah, known for producing high-quality dates. Industrially, there are two cement production plants in the governorate, the most famous of which is the Muthanna Cement Plant. One of them suffers from aging and is located east of the city, being the main source of environmental pollution in the governorate. There are deposits of sodium salts used in food salt production abundantly in the western part of Samawah near Lake Sawa, a beautiful lake surrounded by sands from all sides, naturally formed thousands of years ago, representing a distinctive investment destination and a recreational area for the city, which lacks recreational facilities.

## Origin of the Name

The word "Samawah" has several meanings mentioned in language dictionaries and history books. Al-Husayni quoted Yaqut al-Hamawi in his book "Mu'jam al-Buldan" (1429 AH) as saying that it was called Samawah because it is a flat land without stones. Al-Munjid indicates that Samawah means "the high thing" and "elevated." Sheikh Ahmad Rida explains in his book "Mu'jam al-Lughah" that Samawah means "the high thing," so its edge is high. Some historical sources mention that the area where the city of Samawah is currently located was established before Islam as a city called "Al-Yas." It served as a rest stop for Arab armies and a gathering place for fighters from Arab tribes who fought the Persians and resisted their influence. It witnessed a major battle between the Arabs led by Khalid ibn al-Walid and the Persians led by Jabban. Yaqut al-Hamawi mentioned in his book "Mu'jam al-Buldan" that "Al-Yas - the place where the battle between the Muslims and the Persians took place in the first land of Iraq from the desert side..." Al-Baladhuri said: "Al-Yas - the place where the battle took place between the Muslims and the Persians."

## Modern Era

In the modern era, the earliest mention of Samawah was found in the Ottoman documents in 1494 AD, describing it as an agricultural village located on the bank of the Athshan River, the original Euphrates River, which changed its course in 1700 to its current course due to a major flood that inundated the area. It was also under the rule of the Safavids in 1662 during the reign of Shah Abbas I, who strengthened their military protection in 1625 after their victory over Bakr Sobaash. In 1758, the British doctor and traveler Eves passed through it on his way from Basra to Al-Hillah and Baghdad, and he found it to be a walled city with mud houses. In its desert, there is a lot of salt, and there are 33 archaeological sites in the area, ranging in age from 3200 BC to modern Islamic eras.
