# Dohuk Governorate

Dohuk Governorate (Assyrian: ܢܘܗܕܪܐ(ܕܗܘܟ), Kurdish: دهۆک) is an Iraqi governorate in the Kurdistan Region, with its capital in the city of Dohuk. It includes Zakho near the Ibrahim Khalil border crossing with Şırnak Province in Turkey. It is bordered by Syria's Al-Hasakah Governorate to the west. Its population was estimated at 1,292,535 in 2018.

## History

Dohuk gained significant importance during the years of economic blockade on Iraq imposed following the Gulf War, as it served as a commercial gateway being situated on the border with Turkey.

## Population

The Kurds predominantly inhabit Dohuk Governorate, with Arab, Assyrian, and Armenian minorities. There were also Jewish communities in the area. The main religious groups include Muslims, Yazidis, and Christians.

## Geography

Dohuk Governorate is located in the far northwest of Iraq, forming the westernmost part of the Iraqi Kurdistan Region. It has a strategic location, being situated at the border triangle (Syria, Turkey, and Iraq). The governorate lies between the latitudes of 36-40 and 37-20 degrees to the north, making it north of the equator in the northern temperate zone.

Dohuk is one of the most important governorates, with special significance both historically and geographically. Its terrain, comprising high mountains and fertile plains, forms the political borders with the Republic of Turkey. The southern region of the governorate, with an area of approximately 1075 square kilometers, is an agricultural resource. Due to the lack of accurate records at present, the Directorate of Census and Registration relies on old records, with a reliable population growth rate. It is administratively divided into the following districts: Dohuk, Sumel, Zakho, Al-Amadiyah, Shekhan, and Akre.

The city of Dohuk is surrounded by mountains on three sides, with the White Mountain to the north, Mount Zawa to the south, and Mam Sine to the east. To the west, it opens up to the agricultural plain of Sumel. Dohuk has many archaeological sites, including the Gara Cave located in the mountainous area of Dohuk Dam, with over 15 other archaeological sites.

Dohuk city is renowned for its abundant orchards and famous fruits. The city has expanded urbanistically over the past decades towards other governorates.

Several Kurdish tribes inhabit Dohuk Governorate, including the Doski tribe, which considers a part of Dohuk's lands as their agricultural lands, as well as the Mazuri, Zibari, and Barwari tribes, which are ancient tribes preserving their customs and traditions passed down from their ancestors, distinguished by their traditional attire. There are also other tribes.
