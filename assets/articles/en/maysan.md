# Maysan Governorate

Maysan Governorate is one of the provinces of Iraq, located in the eastern part of the country on the Iranian border. Its capital is Amarah, situated on the Tigris River, and its second-largest city is Al-Majar Al-Kabir. Before 1976, it was known as Amarah Province. The name is believed to have originated from the Kingdom of Mishan and then changed to Maysan. It is located approximately 320 kilometers southeast of the capital Baghdad and about 180 kilometers from Basra. The population of the governorate is around 1.5 million according to the 2014 census.

## Districts and Sub-districts

Maysan Governorate consists of five districts in addition to the Amarah District, which are:

- **Ali Al-Gharbi District**

- **Al-Adel Sub-District**

Amarah owes its development to its excellent location, as it appears beautiful to the viewer from the ship's deck, thanks to its corniche extending along the Tigris River. This corniche features houses built of bricks, divided into several separate shops along wide, straight streets. This beautiful facade appears as if it hides behind it the true architecture of the city with its mud buildings, terraces, orchards, and cultivated fields. Amarah consists of the following localities:

- **Al-Qadiriya (Al-Jadeeda)**
- **Al-Sariya**
- **Al-Saray**
- **Al-Mahmoudiya**
- **Al-Sabunjiya**
- **Al-Shubanna**
- **Al-Dubaysat**

## Landmarks

The governorate is characterized by many landmarks, including the central district of Al-Majidiya in the capital city of Amarah, south of Iraq. On the banks of the Al-Kahla River, the monument of the Maysanese woman, also known as the Tswahan Monument, is located. It gained widespread fame in the southern regions of Iraq, symbolizing the hardworking and nurturing woman in those areas. The monument stands at a height of 32 meters and was constructed by the late sculptor Ahmad Al-Bayati, who passed away on September 14, 2014, at the age of 70. The monument's construction dates back to the 1980s, and various stories exist regarding the reasons for its construction and naming. However, the most powerful narrative confirms that the monument symbolizes the Maysanese woman who stood alongside Iraqi fighters during the Iraq-Iran War. It also symbolizes the women of the governorate who suffered greatly from the wars and problems that southern Iraq regions experienced in recent years. The monument is unique in Iraq because it specifically portrays a woman. Typically, there are hundreds of statues and memorials, but they commemorate historical leaders and figures. The monument depicts a proud Maysanese woman holding a wheelbarrow and peace doves on her head. She also holds some plant leaves that grow in the marshes of Maysan, and this woman is draped in brown, representing the color of the men's cloak in the province, symbolizing the protection of the Maysanese woman.
