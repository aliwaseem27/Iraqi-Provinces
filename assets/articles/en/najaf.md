# Najaf Governorate

Najaf Governorate is one of the eighteen provinces of Central Euphrates and Iraq, with its center being the city of Najaf. It is a province with a significant religious and historical character due to the presence of many Shiite Islamic shrines, the Valley of Peace area, and the Kufa Mosque. It is home to the largest cemetery in the world, Wadi al-Salam Cemetery, which contains six million graves and is one of the oldest cemeteries in history, covering an area of 10 square kilometers.

## Location

Najaf is one of the provinces in central Iraq, located on the edge of the western plateau of Iraq southwest of the capital Baghdad, about 161 km away. The city is elevated 70 meters above sea level and is bordered to the north and northeast by the city of Karbala, which is about 80 km away, and to the south and west by the lowlands of Najaf Sea.

## Establishment

Najaf today is the area of "Najaf al-Kufa" (to distinguish it from Najaf al-Hira) and it is an Arab town that was formerly a summer resort for the Mandaeans (the kings of Hira). Before the Islamic conquest, Christian monasteries were widespread in the area. The town flourished and its population increased significantly due to the presence of the tomb of Imam Ali, which gave the city a sense of reverence and made it a center of religious leadership and a destination for scholars. Najaf is an Arabic name meaning "the elevated," derived from the word "najaf," which means "that which water does not surpass," indicating its high land resembling a dam that holds back water. Najaf also means "the hill" and has been called by many names, including those mentioned in the traditions of the Ahl al-Bayt, as well as those commonly used like Najaf, Al-Ghari, and Al-Mashhad. It is said that Najaf was a great mountain, and it was the one Ibn Nuh referred to when he said: "I will take refuge on a mountain that will protect me from the water." Then it was cut off and became fine sand by the will of God. The sea was called "Ni" at that time, then it dried up, so it was called "Ni Jaf," and it was named Najaf because it was lighter on the tongues.
