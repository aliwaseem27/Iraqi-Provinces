# Erbil Governorate

Erbil Governorate (Kurdish: پارێزگای ھەولێر) is one of the governorates located in northern Iraq. The city of Erbil was the capital of the autonomous region granted to the Kurds according to the March 11 statement, which the Iraqi government recognized granting autonomy to the Kurds in 1970. Currently, it serves as the capital of the Kurdistan Region of Iraq, which was formed following the First Gulf War in 1991.

Erbil Governorate is situated in northern Iraq, bordered by Turkey to the north and Iran to the east. It covers an area of 13,165 square kilometers. The governorate lies within plains with a transitional climate between the Mediterranean and desert climates. It is known for its extreme cold and low humidity, and Erbil was considered the summer capital of Iraq during the previous regime due to its historical significance across the ages and its role as a cultural and civilizational center in northern Iraq.

## History

The history of the construction of the city of Erbil dates back over 7,000 years, and it is not precisely known who built it. The historical origin of its name is believed to be either Sumerian or Assyrian, named "Arba Ilu," meaning four gods, as there was a temple with four gods on the citadel. This was mentioned in Assyrian inscriptions. The decisive battle of Gaugamela between Alexander the Great and the Persian King Darius III is believed to have taken place near the Erbil Citadel, about two kilometers north of the city. Erbil has been inhabited by prominent figures such as Salah ad-Din al-Ayyubi and was a center of worship during the Assyrian era. The Assyrians held Erbil in reverence. Arabs, under the leadership of Utbah ibn Farqad, reached Erbil and its surroundings during the caliphate of Umar ibn al-Khattab in 32 AH. Erbil's outskirts contain more than 110 archaeological hills and sites dating back to ancient civilizations from the Stone Age to the early Islamic era. Among the most significant archaeological landmarks are the Erbil Citadel and the Tell Gara Gawa (the Minaret), believed to have been built during the Atabeg era (Zengid Sultanate), famous for Sultan Mudhaffar, who was the fourth husband of Salah ad-Din al-Ayyubi's sister.
