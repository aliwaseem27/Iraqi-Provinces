# Babil Governorate

Babil Governorate is one of the provinces located in central Iraq, south of the capital Baghdad. It is the fifth largest province in terms of population in Iraq, with an estimated population of around 2,065,042 million people according to the estimates of the Iraqi Ministry of Planning for the year 2018.

## History and Naming
The word "Babil" means "Gate of God," and it became Babylon after the fall of the Sumerians, the base of the Babylonian Empire established by Hammurabi around 2100 BCE. The Babylonian civilization flourished during Hammurabi's rule, considered the golden age of Iraqi history. Babylon was famous for the Hanging Gardens of Babylon, one of the Seven Wonders of the World. It had eight gates, with the grandest being the Ishtar Gate. Babylon has been known by several names, including Babelonia and Bab-ilim.

## Geography
The terrain of Babil Governorate slopes southward about 35 meters above sea level. It has a desert climate characterized by scarce rainfall and high temperatures in summer, reaching up to 50Â°C, with warm weather in winter.

## Historical Events
Babil Governorate has witnessed significant historical events, including its participation in the 1920 Iraqi revolt against British occupation. The British forces suffered heavy losses during an attack on a supply convoy in the Reranjah area north of Hilla.
