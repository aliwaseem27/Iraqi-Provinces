# Thi Qar Governorate

Thi Qar Governorate is located in the southern part of Iraq. It is bordered by Wasit Governorate to the north, Basra Governorate to the south, Maysan Governorate to the east, and Al Muthanna Governorate to the west.

The area of Thi Qar Governorate is 12,900 square kilometers, equivalent to 5,160,000 dunams. The population of the governorate is approximately 1,800,000 people according to the latest unofficial census (based on the ration card), and it is expected to increase significantly in the coming decade due to improvements in economic and security conditions. The area of the marshes is 1,048,600 dunams, and the percentage of Thi Qar Governorate's area in relation to the area of Iraq is 3.1%.

The Euphrates River crosses the governorate from north to south and passes through most of its southern cities. The northern cities are nourished by tributaries from the Tigris River, so the governorate utilizes both the Tigris and Euphrates rivers simultaneously, and the two rivers contribute to the creation of marshes in the area.

In addition to the presence of vast oil fields, several fields are located in the governorate, including the Gharraf field, the Rafidain field, the Abu Amoud field, the Siba field, and other undiscovered fields. The estimated oil reserve is more than 6 billion barrels, in addition to many other minerals and raw materials.

It is worth mentioning that the Nasiriyah Thermal Power Station, located in the western part, currently generates 600 megawatts of electricity.

The governorate consists of 20 administrative units divided into 5 districts:

- Nasiriyah
- Suq Al-Shuyukh
- Al-Jabayish
- Shatrah
- Al-Rifai

And 15 sub-districts:

## History of Thi Qar

The land of Thi Qar is the cradle of civilizations, divine messages, and glories.

Thi Qar, the Great Euphrates, is located in the heart of Nasiriyah, the center of the governorate, where the Sumerian civilization flourished on its banks, and where the immortal epic of Gilgamesh was written.

Thi Qar, the mother of history, present in the depths of time, guarded by the monuments of Ur, embraced by Muthanna with its noble robe.

And Thi Qar, due to the frequent use of "Qar" in its structures, was called the land of Sumer in ancient times, Wasit during the Umayyad era, Al-Bata'ih in the Abbasid era, and Al-Muntafiq during the Ottoman era, named after Al-Muntafiq bin 'Amr bin' Ikil bin Ka'b bin Rabi'ah bin 'Amr bin Sa'sa'ah.

Its sheikhdom fell under the control of the Al-Saadun family affiliated with the Basra province. In the era of Baghdad's governor Mustafa Nuri Pasha in 1860, the Emirate of Al-Muntafiq was turned into a district affiliated with Baghdad, and Sheikh Mansur bin Rashid Al-Saadun was appointed as its administrator in 1869 during the era of the governor Madhat Pasha. Nasser Al-Saadun was asked to build a city in the outskirts of Al-Muntafiq bearing his name and to be the center of the Al-Muntafiq district and its base. Thus, it became known as the Nasseriyah district, and after the issuance of the law of governorates, it was named the Nasiriyah Governorate instead of the Nasseriyah district. It was then renamed Thi Qar Governorate after the Battle of Thi Qar. It was called the mother of history and the bride of the Euphrates.

## Archaeological Sites

**Ur**: The cradle of human history (Sumer).

**Ur**:

Located on the bank near the Euphrates River, 15 km southwest of the city of Nasiriyah and 360 km southeast of Baghdad. It is the third capital in the history of Sumerian civilization after Eridu and Uruk. The third dynasty of Ur, which ruled from 2113 to 2006 BC, hosted kings such as Torna, his son Shulgi, and his grandson Burson. It witnessed the construction of the moon temple of Nereusil-Ziggurat and was called Ur of the Chaldeans in relation to the birth of the Prophet Abraham (PBUH). Its name is mentioned in the Torah.

Within the residential quarter south of the city lies the House of the Prophet Abraham.

**Tell Luh**: Located about 15 km north of the city of Shatrah, also known as Lakish. Its ruins extend for about 2.5 miles in length and 1.25 miles in width. It is surrounded by a trench, which is the area near Tell al-Hekl, the western gate, and the fortress. One of its most famous rulers was Ur Kajina, known for his social reforms. He is considered the first legislator in history.

**Eridu**: Located 40 km from Nasiriyah, known as Tel Abu Shahrein. It is considered one of the holiest cities of Sumer after Nippur. It is the city that first received kingship from heaven and is the largest Babylonian city.

**Sankarah**: Formerly known as Larsa, located on the western bank of the Euphrates River, about 24 km south-east of Ur. It was famous during the ancient Babylonian era around 200 BC.

**Jowfi / Uma**: A small city whose remains extend about 1 km eastward. It has a history of dangerous incidents as it resisted its neighbor Tell Luh fiercely. There were continuous wars between them. Uma, formerly known as Ama, monopolized the waters of the Euphrates, forcing Lakish to bring water from the Tigris. However, Sargon of Akkad opened all the cities in 235 BC, forming a single kingdom under the name of the Akkadian dynasty. The most famous king, Uma, was King Luqal Zakizi, who ruled over the Euphrates in ancient times.
