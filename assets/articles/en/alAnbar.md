# Al-Anbar Governorate

Anbar Province is an Iraqi province located in western Iraq. It is the largest province in Iraq in terms of area, constituting approximately one third (1/3) of Iraq's total area. Within its borders lie the Western Plateau, with elevations reaching over 900 meters above sea level at its shortest point in western Anbar. It features diverse surface terrains ranging from barren deserts to rocky lands and hills, including towering elevations in the northwest of the province extending from the city of Rawah to the city of Al-Qa'im south of the Euphrates River, with elevations reaching up to 375 meters above sea level (200 meters from the ground). There are also highlands extending along the valleys of Wadi Hauran and near the city of Rutba, and it contains many valleys.

## History

### Etymology

The word "Anbar" is an Arabic word meaning "storehouse", with "Anbar" being the plural form (stores). It was named by the Manadhirah as Anbar because it served as a storehouse for military equipment or because it was a storehouse for wheat, barley, and straw. It was one of the most important cities during the Sassanian occupation of Iraq, as it served as an important military center to protect the capital, Ctesiphon, from Roman attacks.

### Dulaim District

Anbar was known as the Dulaim District, named after the concentration of the Dulaim tribe in this area, and before that, it was known as the Sangar Dulaim. The Ottoman authorities appointed Sheikh Aytha bin Hamad Al-Dhayab as the governor of the Dulaim Province in 1705 CE.

## Geography

Anbar Province is part of the Arabian Plateau, with undulating terrain featuring small hills and numerous valleys such as Wadi Hauran. Due to its sloping lands and natural vegetation poverty, it is prone to severe erosion. Surface water, groundwater, and winds work to diversify its surface, with the highest elevation of the Western Plateau near the Jordanian border reaching over 800 meters above sea level, and dropping to 75 meters above sea level in the areas of Habaniyah. The Euphrates River cuts through the Western Plateau, with its rocks gradually descending towards the depressions of Tharthar, Habaniyah, and Razzaza. In some areas, the course of the Euphrates River is narrow, leading to the appearance of limestone and gypsum rocks along its path.

## Climate

It is characterized by a semi-desert climate with low rainfall and a large variation between daytime and nighttime temperatures and low humidity. Temperatures can rise to 52 degrees Celsius in summer and drop to 9 degrees Celsius in winter. Winds are predominantly northwesterly and southwesterly, sometimes reaching maximum speeds of 21 m/s. The average rainfall in winter is about 115 mm.

## Education

The province contains educational centers, government and private schools, as well as universities. The most important universities include:

- Anbar University
- Al-Ma'arif University College
- Middle Technical University (Al-Saqlawiyah)
- University of Fallujah

## Agriculture

The most important agricultural crops include wheat, spring and autumn potatoes, barley, yellow corn, a variety of vegetables, pulses, and fodder. It has a large number of orchards, containing 2.5 million palm trees, and agriculture relies on surface irrigation or on wells, springs, and rainfall.

## Natural Resources

Anbar contains around 5.3 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, in addition to numerous mineral resources such as gold, phosphates, iron, uranium, sulfur, and silver. In the 1980s, a massive reserve of crude oil and gas was discovered in the Akkas field in the western desert south of Al-Qa'im city. In 2001, a new oil area was discovered in the Anbar desert, and the government had plans to drill exploratory wells there, but the invasion of Iraq prevented that. Oil experts expect the possibility of up to 300 billion barrels of crude oil in the Anbar desert, which is believed to be the reason for the attempts of US forces to control the Anbar area during the first five years of the American invasion.

## Tourism

Anbar contains many tourist attractions, the most famous being the lakes: Lake Habaniyah, Lake Tharthar, Lake Qadisiyah, Lake Razzaza, and Lake A'ana. There are also natural sulfur springs in Wadi Hajlan, used for treatment and tourism. Among the archaeological sites are Hit Castle, historical mills, Anah Minaret, and ancient mosques. In Al-Baghdadi district, caves dating back to ancient times have been found. In Anbar, there are islands in the Euphrates River such as Alos Island, Jaba Island, Bad Island, Began Island, and other small islands in the Haditha district. Anbar Province has vast desert areas, valleys, and highlands with beautiful natural landscapes located on the banks of the Euphrates River, where palm orchards and citrus fruits flourish.
